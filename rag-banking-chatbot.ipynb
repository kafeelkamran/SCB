Here are some general guidelines and requirements to help you understand the process better:\\n\\n1. Types of accounts: Banks in Saudi Arabia offer different types of accounts for non-residents, such as savings accounts, current accounts, and term deposits. You can choose an account that suits your needs based on factors like interest rates, fees, and minimum balance requirements.\\n2. Documentation: To open a bank account, you will need to provide certain documents, including:\\n\\t* Passport (original and copy)\\n\\t* Residence permit or visa (if applicable)\\n\\t* Proof of income or employment (such as a salary certificate or letter from your employer)\\n\\t* Proof of address (such as a utility bill or lease agreement)\\n3. Minimum balance requirement: Some banks may require a minimum balance to open and maintain an account. This amount varies depending on the type of account and the bank's policies.\\n4. Fees and charges: Non-resident bank accounts often come with higher fees and charges compared to local accounts. These may include monthly maintenance fees, transaction fees, and ATM withdrawal fees.\\n5. Interest rates: The interest rates offered on non-resident accounts may be lower than those for local accounts. However, some banks may offer competitive interest rates for certain types of accounts or deposit amounts.\\n6. Account management: As a non-resident, you may not be able to visit the bank branch in person to manage your account. Many banks in Saudi Arabia offer online banking services, mobile apps, or international representative offices where you can perform transactions and access your account information remotely.\\n7. Tax implications: It is essential to understand the tax implications of having a bank account in Saudi Arabia as a non-resident. Consult with a tax professional or financial advisor to determine how your account may affect your tax obligations.\\n8. Compliance regulations: Banks in Saudi Arabia must comply with strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. They may request additional documentation or information to verify your identity and source of funds before opening an account.\\n9. Currency restrictions: Some banks may have limitations on the currencies you can use to fund your account or make transactions. Ensure you understand any currency restrictions before opening an account.\\n10. Customer support: Look for a bank that offers reliable customer support, especially if you plan to manage your account remotely. Check their contact channels, response times, and language capabilities to ensure you receive assistance when needed.\\n\\nIn summary, opening a bank account in Saudi Arabia as a non-resident requires careful planning, research, and preparation. Understand the different types of accounts available, the required documentation, fees, and interest rates before making a decision. Additionally, consider the tax implications, compliance regulations, currency restrictions, and customer support when choosing a bank for your non-resident bank account in Saudi Arabia.\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":49},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 🦜🔗 Langchain\n\n- Multiple document retriever with LangChain","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"CFG.model_name","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-12T10:28:11.612201Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-12T10:28:11.612494Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-12T10:28:11.617469Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-12T10:28:11.612469Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-12T10:28:11.616541Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":50,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'llama2-13b-chat'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":50},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Loader\n* Directory loader for multiple files\n* This step is not necessary if you are just loading the vector database\n* This step is necessary if you are creating embeddings.
